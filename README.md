### Create workflows via drag & drop

Drag & drop logical building blocks to create your flows. Easily build flows which connect various apps, services, data sources and more.

### Save time with our growing library

Choose from a variety of nodes published and maintained by the qibb community. Install or update nodes with just a click. Not found what you are looking for? We are compatible with the Node-Red library, which is powered by one of the largest open source communities, offering thousands of nodes at your fingertips.

### Write code online

Directly code in the browser with syntax highlighting and code hinting. Write logic in vanilla javascript or import your favorite libraries.

### Expose your flow as an API

Make your flow available as a secure and fully documented API. Automatically generate an OpenAPI Specification, so that any consumer can understand and interact with your API with a minimal amount of implementation effort. Serve an interactive documentation of your flow, making it effortless for other team members to interact or try out your endpoints.

### Track your changes

Track and manage changes of flows with the help of version control. You can sync your flows directly with Git repositories.

### Deploy with ease
Spin up new flows with a few clicks and almost no waiting time.
Deploy and run your flows anywhere. qibb can deploy flows on top of Kubernetes.


## Dashboard system
Create dashboards which extend your workflow integrations with modular user interfaces.

### Dashboards for everyone
Use dashboards as a frontend for your flows to display data, trigger actions and more. Choose from a variety of dashboard grids to fit your use cases. Create a responsive dashboard which automatically fits the content to your screen or has the look and feel of a scrollable web page.

### Quickly access your dashboards
Pin dashboards to your navigation sidebar for quick access. Reduce overall clicks needed to reach frequently used dashboards by pinning them to your navigation sidebar.

### Collaborate with your team
Create private dashboards to fit your personal needs or share them with other users for collaboration. Share dashboards with your colleagues by making them members with a given role, such as viewer, editor or maintainer.

### Personal home screens for you and your team
You can set a dashboard to become your personal home screen and therefore have all relevant information and actions available right after login. A dashboard can also be promoted as the default home screen for others, allowing a tailored user experience for different users and groups.

### Widgets
Choose from a wide range of widgets and drag & drop them freely into your dashboard. Our built-in widgets allow you to quickly reach resources, load and embed external web resources, write formatted text and much more.
